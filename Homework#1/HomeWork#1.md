# Homework #1

## Task Requirements

### Components
- RGB LED (minimum 1)
- Potentiometers (minimum 3)
- Resistors
- Wires


### Technical Task
Use a separate potentiometer to control each of the colors of the RGB LED.
The LED must be controlled with software, meaning you must read the value of the potentiometers with Arduino, and write a mapped value to each of the pins connected to the LED.

### Coding Task
Coding style is of utmost importance. Magic numbers are not accepted and style consistency is key.

### Publishing Task
The git repository must contain a README with the requirements, setup pictures and a video presenting the functionality.
