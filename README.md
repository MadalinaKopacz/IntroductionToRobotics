# Introduction to Robotics (2022 - 2023)


Introduction to Robotics laboratory homeworks, taken in the 3rd year at the **Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science**, University of Bucharest. 

Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code and image files.

  <summary> Homework #1</summary>

### Task Requirements

#### Components
- RGB LED (minimum 1)
- Potentiometers (minimum 3)
- Resistors
- Wires


#### Technical Task
Use a separate potentiometer to control each of the colors of the RGB LED.
The LED must be controlled with software, meaning we must read the value of the potentiometers with Arduino, and write a mapped value to each of the pins connected to the LED.

#### Coding Task
Coding style is of utmost importance. Magic numbers are not accepted and style consistency is key.
