# Homework #1


## Task Requirements

### Components
- RGB LED (1 minimum)
- Potentiometers (3 minimum)
- Resistors
- Wires


### Technical Task
Use a separat potentiometer in controlling each of the color of the RGB LED.
The control must be done with digital electronics, meaning you must read the value of the potentiometer with Arduino, and write a mapped value to each of the pins connected to the LED.

### Coding Task
Coding style is of utmost importance. Magic numbers are not accepted and style consistency is key.

### Publishing Task
The Git repo must contain a readme with setup pictures, video presenting the functionality and task requirements.
